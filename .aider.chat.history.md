#### https://github.com/team-telnyx/openapi-internal/blob/master/prod/external/verify/verify.json based off of this openapi spec, can you tell me how to add the new verify by id endpoint to my python SDK for Telnyx?

To add the new "verify by id" endpoint to your Python SDK for Telnyx, you will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `telnyx/api_resources/verification.py` - To add the new method for the "verify by id" endpoint.
2. `telnyx/api_requestor.py` - If there are any specific request handling changes needed for the new endpoint.

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

To add the new "verify by id" endpoint to your Python SDK for Telnyx, we need to:

1. Add a new method to the `Verification` class in `telnyx/api_resources/verification.py` to handle the "verify by id" endpoint.
2. Ensure that the new method correctly constructs and sends the request.

Here are the necessary changes:

### Step 1: Add the new method to `Verification` class

telnyx/api_resources/verification.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    @classmethod
    def sms(cls, **params):
        return Verification.create_sms(None, **params)

    @classmethod
    def psd2(cls, **params):
        return Verification.create_psd2(None, **params)

    @classmethod
    def call(cls, **params):
        return Verification.create_call(None, **params)

    @classmethod
    def flashcall(cls, **params):
        return Verification.create_flashcall(None, **params)

    @classmethod
    def whatsapp(cls, **params):
        return Verification.create_whatsapp(None, **params)
=======
    def verify_by_id(self, verification_id, code):
        return self.request(
            method="post",
            url="/v2/verifications/{}/actions/verify".format(verification_id),
            params={"code": code},
        )
        
    @classmethod
    def sms(cls, **params):
        return Verification.create_sms(None, **params)

    @classmethod
    def psd2(cls, **params):
        return Verification.create_psd2(None, **params)

    @classmethod
    def call(cls, **params):
        return Verification.create_call(None, **params)

    @classmethod
    def flashcall(cls, **params):
        return Verification.create_flashcall(None, **params)

    @classmethod
    def whatsapp(cls, **params):
        return Verification.create_whatsapp(None, **params)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a new method `verify_by_id` to the `Verification` class, which constructs the URL using the `verification_id` and sends a POST request with the `code` parameter.

No changes are needed in `telnyx/api_requestor.py` for this specific addition, as the existing request handling should suffice.

With these changes, you should be able to use the new "verify by id" endpoint in your Python SDK for Telnyx.

To bump the version of `black`, the most likely file that needs to be edited is `setup.py`. Please add `setup.py` to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

To bump the version of `black`, we need to add it to the `install_requires` section in `setup.py`. Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to make this change:

setup.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    ],
=======
        "black >= 23.0",
    ],
